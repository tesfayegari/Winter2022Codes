	<h2>Overview</h2>			
	<p id="introduction" class="emphasis">The wolverine, also referred to as glutton, carcajou, skunk bear, 
	or quickhatch, is the largest land-dwelling species of the family 
	Mustelidae (weasels). It is a stocky and muscular 
	carnivore, more closely resembling a small bear than other mustelids. 
	The wolverine has a reputation for ferocity and strength out of 
	proportion to its size, with the documented ability to kill prey 
	many times larger than itself.
	</p>
	<p>The wolverine can be found primarily in remote reaches of the 
	Northern boreal forests and subarctic and alpine tundra of the 
	Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest numbers in northern 
	Canada, the U.S. state of Alaska, the Nordic countries of Europe, 
	and throughout western Russia and Siberia. Their populations have 
	experienced a steady decline since the 19th century in the face of 
	trapping, range reduction and habitat fragmentation, 
	such that they are essentially absent in the southern end of their 
	European range. 
	Large populations are thought to remain in North America and 
	northern Asia. Wolverines are solitary animals. In February 2013, 
	the United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed 
	giving Endangered Species Act protections to the wolverine largely 
	because climate change 
	is whittling away its wintry habitat in the northern Rockies.

	<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>

	<p>Anatomically, the wolverine is a stocky and muscular animal. 
	With short legs, broad and rounded head, small eyes and short 
	rounded ears, it resembles a bear more than 
	other mustelids. Though its legs are short, its large, five-toed 
	paws and plantigrade posture 
	facilitate movement through deep snow.

	<p class="emphasis">The adult wolverine is about the size of a medium dog, with a 
	length usually ranging from 65-107 cm (26-42 in), a tail of 
	17-26 cm (6.7-10 in), and a weight of 9-25 kg (20-55 lb), 
	though exceptionally large males can weigh up to 32 kg (71 lb). 
	The males are as much as 30% larger than the females and can be 
	twice the females' weight. Shoulder height is reported from 
	30 to 45 cm (12 to 18 in). It is the largest of 
	terrestrial mustelids; only the marine-dwelling sea otter and giant 
	otter of the Amazon basin are larger.
	</p>
	<p>Wolverines have thick, dark, oily fur which is highly hydrophobic, 
	making it resistant to frost. This has led to its traditional 
	popularity among hunters and trappers 
	as a lining in jackets and parkas in Arctic conditions. 
	A light-silvery facial mask is distinct 
	in some individuals, and a pale buff stripe runs laterally 
	from the shoulders along the side and crossing the rump just 
	above a 25-35 cm (9.8-14 in) bushy tail. Some 
	individuals display prominent white hair 
	patches on their throats or chests.
